/* 
 * Modified by metric / arcanistry
 * 1. Updated to use proper floats for full precision of textures and colors etc.
 *   - This is important for VR headsets especially when it comes to colors / textures.
 * 2. _LineCol is now properly applied. It was being multiplied in the original source
 *   - rather than added. The _LineCol alpha is used as the add power for the _LineCol.rgb: 0 alpha = nothing; 1 alpha = pure white.
 * 3. Added _Shape which acts as an overall shape mask. 
 *	- Since, with this material on the UI element, you cannot specify an actual sprite to use as a mask.
 *	- With this you can specify the overall general shape, rather than just a single sphere, rounded square, or square.
